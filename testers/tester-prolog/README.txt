This contains the source code associated with the bachelor thesis "Development of an Automated Testing System for Swi-prolog" by Silver Schnur. SWI-Prolog version 7.2.3 and Python 3.5.2 were used to develop the tester.
Gitpython is required to use repo_tester.py, which is designed to run tests against all possible commits in a Git repository.
The current tester and tests used for that are not included, however the results produced by running the repo_tester.py are available in the CSV files.
The PlUnit fork EPlUnit is available in the tests folder and any of the tests there can be executed by running "swipl -g run_tests [test_name]"
